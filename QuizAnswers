Polymorphism

WHAT DOES THE WORD 'POLYMORPHISM' MEAN?

Something that occurs in many different forms/shapes.



WHAT DOES IT MEAN WHEN WE APPLY POLYMORPHISM TO OO DESIGN?

It means that we are using methods inherited from different classes and using them to perform different tasks/actions.



WHAT CAN WE USE TO IMPLEMENT POLYMORPHISM IN JAVA?

Interfaces in abstract classes



HOW MANY 'FORMS' CAN AN OBJECT TAKE WHEN USING POLYMORPHISM?

As many as you want



GIVE AN EXAMPLE OF WHEN YOU COULD USE POLYMORPHISM



Composition and Aggregation

WHAT DO WE MEAN BY 'COMPOSITION' IN REFERENCE TO OO PROGRAMMING?

An object being made up of other objects



WHEN WOULD YOU USE COMPOSITION?

When one object is part of another object. For example;

Class Page {
    private String Chapter;
    private int pageNum;
}

Class Book {
    private Page page;

    public Book() {
    this.page = new Page();
    }
}


GIVE A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN COMPOSITION AND AGGREGATION?

A child class can exist independently with an aggregation, whereas with a composition the child cannot exist independently



WHAT IS/ARE THE ADVANTAGE(S) OF USING COMPOSITION/AGGREGATION?

Composition allows us to reuse code by multiple Inheritance which ultimately provides better test ability of the classes




WHEN USING COMPOSITION, WHEN AN OBJECT IS DESTROYED, WHAT HAPPENS TO ALL THE OBJECTS IT IS COMPOSED OF?

All of the objects are destroyed



WHEN USING AGGREGATION, WHEN AN OBJECT IS DESTROYED, WHAT HAPPENS TO ALL THE OBJECTS IT IS COMPOSED OF?

If one object is destroyed, the other objects are able to exist independently
